.SH NAME
_printf  
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"\fR
.PP 
_printf 
.B FORMAT 
.B [ARGUMENT]
.B ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function 
.B _printf()
produces output according to a format as described below. 
It writes output to stdout, the standard output stream; 
The function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent 
arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted 
for output.

Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT, or execute according to OPTION

       FORMAT controls the output as in C printf.  Interpreted sequences are:


      \"     double quote

       \\     backslash

       \\a     alert (BEL)

       \\b     backspace

       \\c     produce no further output

       \\e     escape

       \\f     form feed

       \\n     new line

       \\r     carriage return

       \\t     horizontal tab

       \\v     vertical tab

       \\NNN   byte with octal value NNN (1 to 3 digits)


.B Return value
.RS
Upon successful return, the functions return the number of characters printed 
(excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.RE

.B Format of the format string
.RS
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. 
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), 
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, 
each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. 
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, 
and ends with a conversion specifier. 
In between there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, 
an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier.
.RE

.PP
.B The conversion specifier
.RS
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. 
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.RE

.B d, i
.RS 
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. 
The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; 
if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. 
The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.RE

.B c
.RS
If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, 
and the resulting character is written. If an l modifier is present, 
the wint_t (wide character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by 
a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state, 
and the resulting multibyte string is written.
.RE

.B s
.RS
.PP The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). 
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); 
if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written. 
If a precision is given, no null byte need be present; if the precision is not specified, 
or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.RE
